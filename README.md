# WPFRegisterStudent

The requirement of this application was providing an interface for a student to register for classes,
The things partciularly done well in my opinon are just general understanding of Visual Basic, WPF seemed very familiar to me despite never using it, due to my extensive knowledge of visual basic

Both designs worked, and did the same thing, however most end users will prefer a gui application for their registration so the WPF version would be more 'professional'
I didn't design anything I was given a piece of code with the user interface already established and I just had to make the code which made this assignment quite easy.

My main methods for debugging code are look at the IDE for the red squiggly lines that indicate there is a problem, fix those, then utilize the console as you attempt to launch the game/program
If you don't understand an error you can always look it up to understand how to beat said error for example in one of my projects in the past I had a buffer overflow error and had no clue
how to actually manage that, looked it up figured it out fixed the error.

This assignment had no real innovative opportunities it was just very easy so I don't really know how to answer this question.
